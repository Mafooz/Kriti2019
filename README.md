#Kriti-2019
This is source code of a Website aimed for students of IIT Guwahati for simplifying the access of required study material in thier day to day life.

Following are the main highlights of the website:

Courses on this site can be accessed by anyone without any need of logging in.
Students can upload study material which will get approved by admin and then will be added to the website. Only students of IITG should be allowed to upload study material. For that, the user must verify that he/she is the student of IIT Guwahati by entering his/her username. An OTP will be sent to the given corresponding Outlook mail id to check the authenticity. After that a form will open in which the user will submit the file and also mention the course to which it is related. This form will be submitted to admin where he will verify the content, and add it or delete it.
There might be a case that a student is looking for a particular course which is unavailable on the website. In that case, he/she can fill a form which with required details and that will be sent to the admin.
New Courses can only added by admins. The idea is to make the club secretaries as admin of this website so that they can have the freedom of adding different courses and videos.
